  "name": "BB-RSI Mean Reversion Daily",
  "description": "Daily mean-reversion strategy for U.S. equities that enters long when price closes below the lower Bollinger Band (20,2) and RSI(14)<30, and enters short when price closes above the upper band with RSI(14)>70. Positions are sized so that the maximum per-trade risk equals 1 % of equity. A volatility-based stop is placed 1.5\u00d7ATR(14) from entry. Exits can also occur when price reverts toward the 20-day SMA (handled inside the signal logic).",
