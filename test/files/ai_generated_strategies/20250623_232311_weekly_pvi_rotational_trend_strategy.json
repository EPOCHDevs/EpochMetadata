  "name": "Weekly PVI Rotational Trend Strategy",
  "description": "Intermediate-term trend-following strategy that trades U.S. equity ETFs on weekly bars. A long position is opened when the Positive Volume Index (PVI) closes above its 20-week EMA and the ETF\u2019s close sets a higher high versus the prior week. Positions are reviewed each weekend and are exited on any of the following: (1) PVI falls back below its 20-week EMA, (2) the weekly close breaks the rolling 10-week low, (3) a 6 % trailing stop from entry based on price, or (4) a 12 % profit target. Capital is allocated equally at 2 % of total equity per trade, with no leverage.",
