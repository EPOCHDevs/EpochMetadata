  "name": "Hurst-ADX Volatility Mean Reversion",
  "description": "Daily mean-reversion equity strategy that buys U.S. large-cap stocks after a volatility expansion out of low-trend conditions identified by low Hurst exponent and ADX values. Long entries occur when the Hurst exponent rises above 0.4 and ADX climbs above 20 within five days after both indicators were below their compression thresholds. Trades exit upon reversion to the 20-day SMA, an ADX surge above 35, or fixed risk-defined stops. Risk is capped at 1 % of equity per trade with a 3 % stop-loss and 6 % profit target.",
