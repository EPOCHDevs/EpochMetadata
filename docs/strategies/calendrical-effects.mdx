# Calendrical Effects & Seasonal Patterns

Calendar-based timing filters: holiday effect, month/week patterns, turn-of-month, quarter-end.

---

## Calendar Scoring System

```epochscript
src = market_data_source()

current_month = month()
dow = day_of_week()

# Month of year (Nov-Apr strong, May-Oct weak)
strong_season = (current_month >= 11) or (current_month <= 4)

# Turn of month (last day + first 3 days)
tom_period = (month() != month()[1]) or (month() != month()[3])

# Week of month
first_week = week_of_month(week="First")
bullish_week = first_week.result

# Day of week
avoid_monday = dow == 1
prefer_friday = dow == 5

# Holiday effect
pre_holiday = holiday(days_before=1)
holiday_boost = pre_holiday.result

# Calendar score
calendar_score = (
    conditional_select(strong_season, 1, 0) +
    conditional_select(tom_period, 1, 0) +
    conditional_select(bullish_week, 1, 0) +
    conditional_select(prefer_friday, 1, 0) +
    conditional_select(holiday_boost, 1, 0) +
    conditional_select(avoid_monday, -1, 0)
)

favorable_calendar = calendar_score >= 2
unfavorable_calendar = calendar_score <= -1

# Adjust aggressiveness
uptrend = ema(period=50)(src.c) > ema(period=200)(src.c)
rsi_val = rsi(period=14)(src.c)
pullback = src.c < ema(period=20)(src.c)

# Favorable calendar: standard entry
entry_favorable = favorable_calendar and uptrend and pullback and (rsi_val < 65)

# Unfavorable calendar: only very strong setups
strong_setup = uptrend and (rsi_val < 35) and (src.v > sma(period=20)(src.v) * 2.0)
entry_unfavorable = (not favorable_calendar) and strong_setup

entry = entry_favorable or entry_unfavorable
exit = calendar_score <= -2  # Very unfavorable

trade_signal_executor(entry, exit)
```

## Session Range Manipulation (Quarter-End)

```epochscript
src = market_data_source()

current_month = month()

quarter_end_month = (
    current_month == 3 or
    current_month == 6 or
    current_month == 9 or
    current_month == 12
)

# Last few days of quarter
# (Approximation—ideally detect last trading day)
late_quarter = quarter_end_month  # Placeholder

# Window dressing: institutions buy winners
winners = src.c > sma(period=60)(src.c) * 1.1  # 10% above 60-day MA
losers = src.c < sma(period=60)(src.c) * 0.9

buy_winners = late_quarter and winners
avoid_losers = late_quarter and losers

entry = buy_winners
exit = avoid_losers

trade_signal_executor(entry, exit)
```

---

## Advanced: Multi-Factor Calendar Filter

```epochscript
src = market_data_source()

# All calendar effects
current_month = month()
dow = day_of_week()
first_week = week_of_month(week="First")
pre_holiday = holiday(days_before=1)

# Month seasonality
strong_months = (current_month >= 11) or (current_month <= 4)
weak_months = (current_month >= 5) and (current_month <= 10)

# September = weakest month
september = current_month == 9

# Turn of month
tom = (month() != month()[1]) or (month() != month()[3])

# Day of week
monday = dow == 1
friday = dow == 5

# Combined risk-on/risk-off
risk_on_calendar = (
    strong_months and
    tom and
    first_week.result and
    friday and
    pre_holiday.result
)

risk_off_calendar = (
    weak_months and
    september and
    monday and
    not tom
)

# Use as portfolio heat adjuster
# Technical signal
signal = crossover(ema(period=20)(src.c), ema(period=50)(src.c))

# Entry sizing/aggressiveness based on calendar
aggressive_entry = risk_on_calendar and signal
conservative_entry = risk_off_calendar and signal and (rsi(period=14)(src.c) < 30)

entry = aggressive_entry or conservative_entry

trade_signal_executor(entry)
```

<Callout type="warning">
Calendar effects have weakened significantly. Use as timing filters, not primary signals. Always combine with technical/fundamental analysis.
