# Limitations

EpochScript looks like Python but has strict constraints for vectorized time-series processing. Understanding these limitations is critical.

---

## Not Python

EpochScript is **declarative**, not imperative. You describe *what* you want, not *how* to compute it.

<Callout type="info">
EpochScript is NOT Python. Many Python features are intentionally excluded to enable vectorized execution across time series.
</Callout>

---

## No Control Flow

**Limitation:** `if`/`elif`/`else` statements are not allowed.

**Reason:** Operations must work vectorized across all time points simultaneously.

**Use instead:** Boolean expressions, ternary operators, or `conditional_select()` for multi-way branching.

---

## No Loops

**Limitation:** `for` and `while` loops are not allowed.

**Reason:** Transforms operate on entire series vectorized.

**Use instead:** Vectorized transforms that automatically apply to all time points. Cross-sectional operations like `top_k()` work across entire universes.

---

## No Variable Reassignment

**Limitation:** Variables are **immutable** - single assignment only.

**Reason:** Prevents temporal logic bugs and enables parallel evaluation.

**Use instead:** Distinct variable names for each value.

---

## No Function Definitions

**Limitation:** `def` keyword is not allowed. Cannot define custom functions.

**Reason:** All transforms must be registered in the system for metadata and visualization.

**Use instead:** Built-in transforms only. Request new transforms to be added to the system if custom logic is needed.

---

## No Class Definitions

**Limitation:** `class` keyword is not allowed.

**Reason:** EpochScript is a pure functional language for time-series operations.

---

## No Exception Handling

**Limitation:** `try`/`except` blocks are not allowed.

**Reason:** All errors are compile-time errors, not runtime exceptions.

---

## No Chained Comparisons

**Limitation:** Python's `a < b < c` syntax is not supported.

**Reason:** Explicit boolean logic is clearer for vectorized operations.

**Use instead:** Explicit `and`/`or` with separate comparisons: `(rsi_val > 30) and (rsi_val < 70)`.

---

## No Negative Indexing

**Limitation:** Python's `list[-1]` for last element is not supported.

**Reason:** Lag operator only accepts positive integers for historical lookback.

**Use instead:** Positive lag indices: `src.c[1]` for 1 bar ago, `src.c[5]` for 5 bars ago.

---

## No Zero Indexing

**Limitation:** Using `[0]` is redundant and not allowed.

**Reason:** Current value is the default without any index.

**Use instead:** Omit the index for current value: `src.c` instead of `src.c[0]`.

---

## Why These Limitations?

These constraints enable:

1. **Vectorized execution** - Operations across entire time series
2. **Compile-time safety** - Catch errors before execution
3. **Automatic visualization** - System knows about all operations
4. **Parallel evaluation** - No temporal dependencies from mutation
5. **Type safety** - Strong type checking without runtime overhead

The limitations aren't arbitrary - they're essential for EpochScript's design goals of safe, fast, visualizable time-series operations.
