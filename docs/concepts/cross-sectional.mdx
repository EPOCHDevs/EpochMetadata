# Cross-Sectional Analysis

Evaluate multiple assets simultaneously at each timestamp to generate rankings, factors, statistical comparisons, and universe filters.

---

## Overview

Cross-sectional transforms operate **across assets at each point in time**, not over time for a single asset. At every timestamp, they compare all assets in your universe to produce rankings, selections, or normalized metrics.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Regular transforms**: Operate on one asset over time (e.g., `sma(period=20)` calculates 20-period average for each asset independently)
- **Cross-sectional transforms**: Operate across all assets at each timestamp (e.g., `cs_zscore()` normalizes each asset relative to the mean/std of all assets at that moment)

## Categories

### 1. Ranking & Selection

Identify top/bottom performers for portfolio construction using cross-sectional comparisons.

**Momentum Tracking:** `cs_momentum` calculates cumulative cross-sectional returns by averaging returns across all assets at each timestamp. Use this to track aggregate universe performance and identify systematic return patterns.

**Asset Selection:** Use ranking transforms to select subsets from your universe:
- `top_k`, `bottom_k` - Select fixed count of best/worst performers
- `top_k_percent`, `bottom_k_percent` - Select percentage of universe (adapts to size changes)

**Common Patterns:**
- Long-only: Select top performers based on momentum or factor scores
- Long-short: Combine top and bottom selections for balanced exposure
- Rotation: Regularly rebalance based on updated rankings

### 2. Statistical Analysis

Normalize and compare metrics across assets for factor investing and risk analysis.

**Cross-Sectional Normalization:** `cs_zscore` normalizes values across assets at each timestamp using `(value - mean_all) / std_all`.

**Key Difference:** Unlike time-series zscore which normalizes one asset over time, cross-sectional zscore normalizes **across multiple assets at one moment**.

**Applications:**
- Combine factors with different units (returns, P/E ratios, volatility)
- Identify statistical outliers relative to peers
- Create mean-reversion signals based on deviation from peer average
- Build multi-factor models with normalized components
