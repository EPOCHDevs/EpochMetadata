# Executors

Executors are required terminal nodes that convert strategy logic into actionable trading signals. Every strategy must include at least one `trade_signal_executor` to be valid.

---

## Overview

**Executors serve as the final output layer** of a strategy, transforming indicator values and conditions into concrete trading actions. Without an executor, a strategy is incomplete - it may calculate indicators and conditions but produces no tradeable output.

**Visual Output:** Executor signals automatically appear as flags on candlestick charts:
- **L** - Enter long position
- **XL** - Exit long position
- **S** - Enter short position
- **XS** - Exit short position

These visual markers make it easy to see strategy behavior and validate signal timing during research and backtesting.

<Callout type="warning" title="Executor Required">
**Every strategy must include at least one executor.** Strategies without executors will fail validation. The `trade_signal_executor` must be connected to boolean values that define entry and exit conditions.

## Requirements

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Must have exactly 1** `trade_signal_executor()` | Bridge between logic and execution |
| **At least 1 signal** required | `enter_long`, `enter_short`, `exit_long`, or `exit_short` |
| **Exits process before entries** | On same bar |

**Common errors:**
- `No trade_signal_executor found` → Add one
- `Multiple trade_signal_executor calls` → Combine into one
- `Requires at least one input` → Provide signals
