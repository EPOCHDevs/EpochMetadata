# Research Reports

Generate interactive dashboards to analyze strategy behavior, discover patterns, validate hypotheses, and visualize multi-asset performance. Reports provide aggregated metrics, distributions, filtered views, and comparative analysis across assets.

---

## Research Objectives

**Pattern Discovery** - Identify recurring market behaviors, event characteristics, and statistical relationships in historical data.

**Hypothesis Validation** - Test trading assumptions by examining metric distributions, regime-specific performance, and conditional outcomes.

**Strategy Analysis** - Evaluate strategy behavior through performance cards, risk metrics, signal frequency, and execution characteristics.

**Factor Research** - Compare asset rankings, analyze cross-sectional relationships, and validate factor exposures across universes.

## Card Reports

Display aggregated metrics as dashboard cards for quick insights.

**Numeric Cards** - Aggregate time-series data into summary statistics (mean, sum, min, max, stddev, first, last, median, skew, kurtosis). Use for performance metrics, risk measures, and strategy characteristics.

**Boolean Cards** - Count signal occurrences and event frequency. Use for trade counts, pattern detections, and condition triggers.

**Index Cards** - Show specific rows by position (first, last) or percentile. Use for extreme value analysis and temporal bookmarks.

**Quantile Cards** - Display distribution percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th). Use for risk profiling and distribution summaries.

**Applications:** Performance dashboards, risk summaries, signal frequency tracking, distribution analysis.

---

## Chart Reports

Visualize distributions, proportions, and categorical breakdowns.

**Bar Charts** - Compare categories with aggregated values (count, sum, mean, min, max). Use for regime-based performance, categorical distributions, and grouped comparisons.

**Pie Charts** - Show proportional breakdowns and composition. Nested pie charts support two-level hierarchies. Use for allocation views, regime distribution, and category proportions.

**Histograms** - Display value distributions and frequency analysis. Configurable bin counts. Use for return distributions, indicator ranges, and statistical profiles.

**Applications:** Regime analysis, performance by category, distribution profiling, allocation visualization.

---

## Table Reports

Filtered row-level data with custom columns for detailed inspection.

**Key Features:**
- Boolean filter column (`select_key`) determines which rows appear
- Multiple data columns with custom titles
- Direct timestamp-level detail for pattern investigation

**Applications:** Extreme condition analysis, signal detail inspection, filtered event views, pattern characteristic examination.

---

## Specialized Reports

**Gap Report** - Comprehensive gap analysis combining cards, histograms, and pivot tables. Provides fill rate metrics, size distributions, timing analysis, and detailed gap characteristics. Use for session gap research and intraday pattern analysis.

**Applications:** Session gap behavior, fill time analysis, gap size distributions, hourly/daily pattern detection.

---

## Cross-Sectional Reports

Multi-asset comparison reports for factor strategies and universe analysis.

**CS Bar Chart** - Compare all assets in a single chart with one bar per asset. Use for sector rankings, factor score comparisons, and side-by-side performance.

**CS Table** - Asset-by-metric table showing aggregated values across the universe (assets as columns). Aggregations: first, last, mean, sum, min, max. Use for factor snapshots and multi-asset metric views.

**CS Numeric Cards** - Card group with one card per asset showing current values. Use for multi-asset dashboards, factor exposure visualization, and comparative metric cards.

**Applications:** Sector performance rankings, factor analysis, cross-sectional momentum, multi-asset risk metrics, universe screening.

---

## Event Markers

Mark important timestamps for timeline navigation and visual pattern identification.

**Event markers create interactive timelines** that allow clicking to jump directly to specific timestamps. Each event displays with a title, timestamp, and color-coded badge.

**Color Categories:**
- **Success (Green)**: Bullish signals, long entries, confirmations, positive pattern detections
- **Error (Red)**: Bearish signals, exits, warnings, negative conditions
- **Warning (Yellow)**: Neutral events, regime changes, pattern formations, informational markers

**Event Marker Schema** requires:
- Boolean filter determining when events occur
- Event classification column mapping to color categories
- Icon and title for the timeline
- Badge configuration with color mappings

**Applications:** Signal timeline visualization, regime change markers, pattern occurrence tracking, strategy entry/exit annotation, extreme condition identification.

## Research Workflows

### Pattern Discovery
Combine histograms for distributions, specialized reports for comprehensive analysis, and summary cards for key metrics. Use to identify gap characteristics, indicator ranges, return profiles, and event frequency.

### Factor Analysis
Use cross-sectional reports (cs_table, cs_bar_chart, cs_numeric_cards) to compare factor values across assets. Combine with histograms to visualize factor distributions and cards for summary statistics. Apply to momentum scoring, volatility comparison, beta analysis, and multi-factor models.

### Regime Detection
Use pie charts for regime proportions, bar charts for performance by regime, table reports for detailed regime conditions, and cards for summary metrics. Apply to market state analysis, conditional performance, and regime-based strategy evaluation.
